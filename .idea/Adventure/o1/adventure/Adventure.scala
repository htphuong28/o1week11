  * turn at a time and for checking the state of the game.
  *
  * N.B. This version of the class has a lot of “hard-coded” information that pertains to a very
  * specific adventure game that involves a small trip through a twisted forest. All newly created
  * instances of class `Adventure` are identical to each other. To create other kinds of adventure
  * games, you will need to modify or replace the source code of this class. */
